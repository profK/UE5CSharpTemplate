# UE5CSharpTemplate

This is a template for writing Unreal 5 applications in C#. It has UnrealSharp pre-integrated.
To use this template:
(1) Create your own repository from this template
(2) Clone that repository to your local drive to create a local project
(3) IMPORTANT: Open UE5 ** from the Epic Launcher ** and open your local project
    You MUST do this with the launcher not the UE5 shortcut.
    When it asks to recompile plugins tell it yes
(4) From this point you can do C# development as per the UnrealSharp docs at
    https://www.unrealsharp.com/get-started.html
